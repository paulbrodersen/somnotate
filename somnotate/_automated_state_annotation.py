        Arguments:
        ----------
        signal_arrays -- list of (total samples, data dimensions) ndarrays of floats
            The collection multidimensional time series signals.
            The data dimensions need to match across signal arrays but the total
            samples in each signal array can vary between arrays.

        state_vectors -- list of (total samples, ) vectors of integers
            The corresponding state for each sample in each signal array,
            represented by an integer.

            Positive integers (1, 2, 3, ... ) are used to denote the
            state of valid samples.  The corresponding samples are
            used to train the linear discriminant.

            Negative integers (-1, -2, -3, ...) are used to denote the
            state of invalid samples. These are samples with a defined
            state, which nevertheless should not be used in training
            of the linear discriminant, as they are, for example,
            outliers or artefacts. These states are used, however, to
            determine the transition probabilities between states.

            Samples with undefined states are denoted by zeros. These
            are used in neither the training of the linear
            discriminant nor the HMM (NaNs cannot be represented by
            ndarrays of dtype int).

        state_transition_threshold -- float
            Discard state transitions that have a probability less than threshold.
            This typically limits the impact of mislabelled samples, and makes the
            HMM more robust.
